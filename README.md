- 👋 Hi, I’m @mbratch (Mark Bratcher)
- 👀 I’m interested in computer languages, software development, Arduino applications, Mathematics, and music.
- 🌱 I’m currently doing some ESP32 development work, and I'm learning Rust with the intent of introducing it to our development organization
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on potentially a variety of interesting projects especially if they need an algorithm or mathematics to solve a problem.
- 📫 How to reach me... probably best through email: just put "@gmail.com" after my user name. :)
